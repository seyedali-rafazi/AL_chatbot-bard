Here is a draft README for a GitHub repo that clones the Google Bard chatbot using the BardAPI:

# Google Bard Chatbot Clone

This project clones the conversational AI capabilities of Google's Bard chatbot using the BardAPI. 

## Overview

- The app allows users to have a conversational chat with an AI assistant powered by the Bard API
- It is built with Streamlit for the front-end UI and interface
- User input is sent to the BardAPI to generate conversational responses
- Chat history is tracked using Streamlit session state to display a persistent chat

## Installation

```
pip install streamlit bardapi
```

You will need an API key for the BardAPI. Sign up and get a key at https://beta.bard.ai/

## Usage

```
streamlit run app.py
```

- Enter a prompt in the input box and hit enter to chat with the AI assistant
- Chat history will be displayed in a chat UI below the input  
- Responses are generated using the BardAPI

## Code Overview

- `app.py` - Main Streamlit app code
- Uses `streamlit_chat` module to display chat UI
- BardAPI key stored as environment variable
- `get_text()` - Get user input 
- `get_response()` - Call BardAPI and return response
- Session state handles chat history

## Customization

The app can be customized by:

- Using a different conversational AI API
- Styling the UI with CSS
- Adding additional features like audio input/output
- Deploying to a server for public use
